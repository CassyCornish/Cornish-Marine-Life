                        <p class="description">These large jellyfish swarm in warmer coastal waters in late spring and often wash up on our beaches in May or June, sometimes in their hundreds. Their favourite meal is plankton, which can be found in shallow waters. This is what often causes them to wash up, as they underestimate their size. They have eight frilly arms, which contain their small stinging tentacles and surround hundreds of little mouths! The sting of the barrel jellyfish is not normally harmful to humans, though if you find one on the beach it's best not to handle it as they can still sting when dead. </p>

                        <p class="description">These clever, streamlined mammals are found in most of the world’s oceans, including around the UK. By protecting marine dolphins like these we’re helping keep our seas healthy – which is good for all the other wildlife, and billions of people, who rely on the sea for their survival. Bottlenose dolphins are generally social creatures that live in groups called ‘pods’, which can contain hundreds of individuals. They sometimes hunt in groups with other dolphins too. By producing clicking sounds and interpreting the returning echoes (‘echo-location’) dolphins can tell the size, shape and speed of objects underwater – that’s how they catch fish, squid and other food.</p>

                        <p class="description">The basking shark is the second largest fish in our oceans - its relative the whale shark being the biggest. Despite their size, basking sharks only feed on zooplankton which they filter out of the water, swimming slowly back and forth with their enormous mouths wide open. They are most commonly seen in the summer, when they arrive in British waters. Courtship behaviour has been seen off the Isle of Man - so perhaps they arrive here to breed! They can be seen from cliffs, but your best chance is to take a boat trip with a reputable wildlife watching company.</p>

                        <p class="description">The grey seal is the larger of the two UK seal species, and if you catch a good look at them you’ll see how they got their scientific name Halichoerus grypus – it means hook-nosed sea pig! These mammals spend most of their time out at sea feeding on fish. They return to land to rest and can often be seen ‘hauled out’, lying on British beaches. Grey seals give birth to fluffy white pups in the autumn. These adorable pups stay on land until they have lost their white coats and trebled their body weight. </p>

                        <p class="description">Common Dolphins (also referred to as short-beaked common dolphins) are an offshore species, but often come close to shore to feed. They are highly social and normally found in groups, travelling at speed and frequently leaping from the water. They feed mainly on fish and will work together to herd their prey into a ball. Common dolphins are fast! They can reach swimming speeds of around 30 miles per hour when chasing food or bowriding alongside boats.</p>

                        <p class="description">Harbour porpoise can be easily spotted close to shore in shallow water, either alone or in small groups. They are shy and will avoid boats and jet skis. If you do manage to get close enough you may hear their loud “chuff” noise as they come to the surface for air, this gives them their nickname “puffing pig”! Harbour porpoise give birth to a small calf every 1-2 years. Harbour porpoises are eating machines! They are warm-blooded mammals and their small size means they have to feed constantly to keep their body temperature up in our chilly seas. They feed mainly on fish, including sand eels, herring and whiting. </p>

                        <p class="description">Humpback whale, (Megaptera novaeangliae), a baleen whale known for its elaborate courtship songs and displays. Humpbacks usually range from 12 to 16 metres in length and weigh approximately 36 metric tons. The body is black on the upper surface, with a variable amount of white below, and it has about 30 broad ventral grooves on the throat and chest. This cetacean is distinguished from other baleen whales by its long, narrow flippers, which are about a third as long as the body and scalloped on the forward edge. Humpbacks also have large knobs on the head, jaws, and body, each knob being associated with one or two hairs. The dorsal fin is small and set far back on the body.</p>

                        <p class="description">This giant of the sea turtle world travels alone, only coming together with other turtles to breed. They lay their eggs on beaches and leave them unsupervised, leaving the baby turtles to make their way to the sea alone once they hatch. These unique animals are specially adapted to be able to cope with colder seas, which means they are able to dive to great depths in order to hunt deep sea jellyfish. They have an incredible (and slightly gruesome) way of making sure they never lose a meal – they have downward facing spines inside their throat that stops prey getting out! Unfortunately, the leatherback turtle can get confused and accidentally eat plastic bags or balloons as they look like jellyfish. </p>
